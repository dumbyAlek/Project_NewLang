# Minimalistic Syntax Kaleidoscope 2 (MSK2)
A compact, clean, and lightweight take on the Kaleidoscope language.

MSK2 is my structured implementation of a small, minimal programming language inspired by the Kaleidoscope compiler tutorial. It emphasizes simplicity in syntax, a clear lexer–parser pipeline, and an extensible foundation for experimenting with language and compiler design. This project acts as a baseline framework that I’ll expand as I explore more features.
